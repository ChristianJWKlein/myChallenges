// Determine if a given array contains a subarray of at least two elements whose sum is a multiple of a specified number k.

// An array is considered to have a "good subarray" if there exists at least one subarray (consisting of two or more elements) such that the sum of the elements in this subarray is a multiple of k.

// For example, the array [23, 2, 4, 7] with k = 6 has a "good subarray" ([2, 4]), as the sum 6 is a multiple of k = 6. The array [5, 0, 0, 0] with k = 3 does not have any "good subarray", as no subarray of two or more elements sums to a multiple of 3.

;(nums = [23, 2, 4, 7]), (k = 6)
output: true

;(nums = [5, 0, 0, 0]), (k = 3)
output: false

;(nums = null), (k = 1)
output: false
